## Live Site <a name = "live_site"></a>
**https://stock-market-service.pandol.sh/api/v1/**

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. First clone the repo and then run the following commands:

There are two options with two steps each:

with Makefile
  - Step 1: `make install` # will create a new environment with venv, then will install the required dependencies listed in requirements.txt
  - Step 2: `make run` # will run a development server for the app in localhost:8000

with docker

  - Step 1: `docker-compose build` # will build the image
  - Step 2: `docker-compose up -d` # will start the image, this will run a development server for the app in localhost:8000


For development usage you can change the ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY used by the system modifying the file `stock_market/settings/.env.dev` before building the image.

### Prerequisites <a name = "prerequisites"></a>

To install and run with `make` you need to have python 3 installed.
To run it with `docker` you need to have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed.


## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

`python manage.py test`


## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
The app has two endpoints, one to register for a new API key and the other one to get the stock data. The code for the endpoints can be found in the `api/views.py` file.
The request and data process of ALPHAVANTAGE API is done in `api/services.py`.
The sign up fields validation is made in `authentication/serializers.py`.

Use `localhost:8000` to access the api in local mode. 

**You can also try the app by going to https://stock-market-service.pandol.sh/api/v1/**

------------

- url: `https://stock-market-service.pandol.sh/api/v1/symbol/<str:symbol>/`
- Receives symbol in the url.
- Requires an API key in the header.

Example request

`curl --request GET \
  --url https://stock-market-service.pandol.sh/api/v1/symbol/ibm/ \
  --header 'Authorization: Token f1d263b4fde5550ba0cff55db25042bfe5915063'`

	"close_value": "130.7900",
	"open_value": "129.5200",
	"high_value": "131.0000",

## ‚õèÔ∏è Throttling <a name = "throttling"></a>

#### Throttling rules

- Anonymous users: 100 requests/day
- Authenticated ¬†users: 1000 requests/day

Error message when throttled

`{
	"detail": "Request was throttled. Expected available in 86399 seconds."
}`

## Logging <a name = "logging"></a>

The class RequestLogMiddleware write a row in a log file called apicalls.log every time a request to the API endpoints is made, listing the request method, the url and the authenticated user.
RequestLogMiddleware is in api/mixins.py

Example 

`[31/Jul/2022 13:56:08] [INFO] [API_REQUEST] GET /api/v1/symbol/ibm/ user@example.com`

`[01/Aug/2022 00:31:01] [INFO] [API_REQUEST] POST /api/v1/register/ AnonymousUser`


## TODO & Ideas <a name = "todo"></a>
- Refactor api/services.py to be able to handle multiple sources of data. Maybe move process_data to a new class Parser to make it more generic.
- Add a new endpoint to get the stock data for a list of symbols.
